### I am a Certified Google Data Analyst
At the end of 2016, After I finish my compulsory youth service corp, I didn't know where my life was going. After some serious self-reflection about my passions and interests, I committed to learning everything I could about Data Analytics, machine learning, data science, and the tech industry.
After graduating with a masters in Agricultural Economics from Kwara State University, malete and a year of working as a freelance, I have officially become a Data analyst in the technology solutuon organization at Platinum Touch technology solution. Here I am utilizing my knowledge of Data analyst, Data Science to build intelligent systems to better the customer experience
